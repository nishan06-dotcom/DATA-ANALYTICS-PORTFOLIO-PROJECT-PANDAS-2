## Key Findings with Output ðŸ“Š

* **Genre Dominance:** The analysis revealed that **'Drama'** was the most frequent genre, accounting for **35 movies** in the dataset, followed closely by 'Comedy' and 'Action'.

* **Top Profitability (ROI):** After engineering a Return on Investment (ROI) metric, the analysis identified the most profitable films. The film **'Aashiqui 2'** topped the charts with an exceptional ROI of over **650%**, demonstrating high returns on a modest budget.

* **Budget Distribution:** A histogram of movie budgets showed a strong right-skewed distribution. The vast majority of films were produced with a budget under **â‚¹40 Crores**, while only a few high-budget films (over â‚¹100 Crores) acted as outliers.

* **Strategic Release Timing:** Movies released during a **'Festive Season'** showed the highest average ROI (**95%**), significantly outperforming movies released during a 'Long Weekend' (60%) or a 'Normal' period (45%).

* **Digital Engagement Impact:** A correlation analysis found a moderately strong positive correlation coefficient of **+0.68** between YouTube trailer likes and box office collections, confirming that higher online engagement is a significant indicator of a film's potential commercial success.
